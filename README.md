## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
### What I learned
I had never created a component like this before, and I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge. I was able to implement the `toggle` functionality in the attributes and play around with it in the code.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing HTML semantics, best practices. I also want to delve into challenges that test my CSS skills. I have practiced a lot of Javascript, I think itâ€™s time to practice a little design to be a good Frontend developer.
